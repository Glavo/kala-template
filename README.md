# Kala Template

[![](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.glavo.kala/kala-template?label=Maven%20Central)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.glavo.kala/kala-template)

This is a lightweight (about 10 KiB) Java templating engine.

It does not have complex structure and functional support.
What it does is very simple, is to insert the content between specific tags into the output after custom mapping.

If you don't need those complicated templating engine features, it's very simple and fast and is probably what you want.

It provides a command line interface, which can be used as a command line tool to generate target files from template files
See the [Use as Command-Line tool](#use-as-command-line-tool) section for usage as a command-line tool.

## Why I choose it?

* It's very lightweight: it's only a jar of about 10 KiB, and it doesn't have any dependencies;
* It is compiled with Java 8, but also provides `module-info.class`, so it has full support for JPMS;
* It's streaming and doesn't need to read the entire file into memory, so it can handle very large files with ease;
* It is easy to expand and can meet most needs on its basis;

## Adding it to your build

It's already published on Maven Central, you can add it to the build like this:

Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.glavo.kala</groupId>
  <artifactId>kala-template</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:
```groovy
implementation("org.glavo.kala:kala-template:0.1.0")
```

## Getting Started

Here is a simple example:

```java
TemplateEngine engine = TemplateEngine.getDefault();

engine.process("Hello ${name}!", Map.of("name", "Glavo")); // --> "Hello Glavo!"
```

`${name}` is replaced by `Glavo`. `${...}` is the default template tag, you can easily customize it:

```java
TemplateEngine engine = TemplateEngine.builder()
        .tag("{%", "%}")
        .build();

engine.process("Hello {%name%}!", Map.of("name", "Glavo")); // --> "Hello Glavo!"
```

---

The above examples all pass a `Map` for the template engine, but you can also pass a `ResourceBundle`:

`simple.properties`:
```properties
user.name=Glavo
user.site=https://glavo.site
```

Java Code:
```java
ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("simple");

TemplateEngine.getDefault()
        .process("Hello ${user.name}! Welcome to ${user.site}", bundle); // --> "Hello Glavo! Welcome to https://glavo.site"
```

And, a more flexible approach is to pass a `Function`:

```java
TemplateEngine.getDefault()
        .process("Welcome to ${Glavo}!", it -> it + "'s site"); // --> "Welcome to Glavo's site!"
```

This gives you extreme flexibility, you can use it to achieve any function you want.

---

Of course, we can do more than just use `String` as input and output as above.
`TemplateEngine` accepts `Reader` as input and `Appendable` as output, so it can accept more input and output forms:

```java
try (Reader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(Paths.get("MyTemplate.xml.template"));
     Writer writer = Files.newBufferedWriter(Paths.get("MyTemplate.xml"))) {
        TemplateEngine.getDefault().process(reader, writer, Map.of(...));
}
```

`TemplateEngine` will read and process the template file streaming, without needing to read the entire file in at once,
and the generated content is also written directly to the `writer`.
Therefore, it can handle large template files efficiently.

To simplify writing input from a template file and output to another file,
`TemplateEngine` provides a builtin overload that allows you to achieve the same functionality as above:

```java
TemplateEngine.getDefault()
        .process(Paths.get("MyTemplate.xml.template"), Paths.get("MyTemplate.xml"), Map.of(...));
```

---

By default `TemplateEngine` throws an exception when an unknown marker is encountered:

```java
try {
    TemplateEngine.getDefault().process("Hello ${someone}!", Map.of("name", "Glavo")); // Failed
} catch (TemplateProcessException e) {
    System.out.println("Failed üò≠");
}
```

However, you can also modify the default behavior:

```java
TemplateEngine engine = TemplateEngine.builder()
        .errorMode(TemplateEngine.ErrorMode.SANITIZE)
        .build();

engine.process("Hello ${someone}!", Map.of("name", "Glavo")); // --> "Hello ${someone}!"
```

Or:

```java
TemplateEngine engine = TemplateEngine.builder()
        .errorMode(TemplateEngine.ErrorMode.STRIP)
        .build();

engine.process("Hello ${someone}!", Map.of("name", "Glavo")); // --> "Hello !"
```

## Use as Command-Line tool

You can download the latest jar from the [release page](https://github.com/Glavo/kala-template/releases) and execute it with `java -jar kala-template.jar`,

We also provide a `.sh` file, which packages jar files in a special way. 
In the environment where java is installed, you can use it as a script to replace `java -jar`.

It accepts two main option: an input file and an output file.

```
$ cat template.txt 
Hello, ${user.name}! ${GREETINGS}

$ export GREETINGS='Nice to see you!'
$ ./kala-template.sh template.txt output.txt

$ cat output.txt 
Hello, glavo! Nice to see you!
```

kala-template searches for values from JVM system properties and environment variables by default.
In this example, `${user.name}` is replaced by the value of `System.getProperty("user.name")`, 
and `${GREETINGS}` is replaced by the value of `System.getenv("GREETINGS")`.

You can disable this behavior with the `--no-system-properties` and `--no-environment-variables` options.

In addition, you can use the `-D<key>=<value>` option to provide a single value 
and the `--properties-file <properties file>` option to provide a properties file containing multiple values:

```
$ cat template.txt 
Glavo's site:   ${glavo.site}
Glavo's GitHub: ${glavo.github}
Donate: ${glavo.donate}

$ cat values.properties 
glavo.github=https://github.com/Glavo
glavo.site=https://glavo.site

$ ./kala-template.sh -Dglavo.donate=https://donate.glavo.site/ --properties-file values.properties template.txt output.txt
 
$ cat output.txt 
Glavo's site:   https://glavo.site
Glavo's GitHub: https://github.com/Glavo
Donate: https://donate.glavo.site/
```

You can also customize tags around variable names:

```
$ cat template.txt 
Hello, {%user.name%}!

$ ./kala-template.sh --begin-tag '{%' --end-tag '%}' template.txt output.txt

$ cat output.txt 
Hello, glavo!
```

You can also use the `--stdin` and `--stdout` option to replace the file with a standard input/output stream.
This can be easily combined with the pipeline.

```
$ cat template.txt 
os.name=${os.name}
os.arch=${os.arch}
os.version=${os.version}

$ ./kala-template.sh template.txt --stdout | grep 'Linux'
os.name=Linux
```

More details can be printed using the `--help` option.
